# Vamsee Jasti

Hey, I live in Alameda, CA right now and before this in New York City - which I still dearly miss sometimes. I work at Google as a Group Product Manager leading Google Chat - yes, the one and final Chat product from Google. 

I've been the PM for other hits at Google like Google Search, Web Stories, AMP for Email, AMP Advertising and AMP. Before Google, I was software engineer at Goldman Sachs until I found my life passion to work as a product manager. 

I like to write about a diverse set of things. Ramblings, technology trends, data-driven experiments, hacks and travels.

All opinons stated are mine and all that good stuff. Drop me a note in any of these medium. Would love to hear from you.
